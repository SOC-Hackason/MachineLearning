Navigating the Intersection of Law and Technology: Two Challenges in Social Informatics

[Abstract]
In this lecture, we explore two challenges related to the use of AI for providing social/legal services.The first challenge is rather general and deals with the gap between the two domain experts needed in order to create social informatics solutions: the social domain expert and the AI expert.The second challenge focuses on law and deals with the asymmetry between using AI to identify and report violations of the law and using AI to handle such violations.The two challenges are based on the experience of the speaker with supporting consumer protection associations in Europe. We will discuss the two challenges and possible solutions.

Dr. Tomer Libal is a researcher in AI and Law in the University of Luxembourg and the founder of Enidia AI, a startup specializing in legal chatbots. Before joining the university of Luxembourg, he had positions in the American University of Paris, Inria France and Microsoft Research.

Congratulations! You’ve officially kicked off your journey with Docker Scout.

We’re so excited to help your team maintain a complete view of your Software Supply Chain more than ever before. Let’s start by getting you set up and showing you around core Scout features!
Getting started
Before you dive in, visit our quickstart guide! This’ll help you set up and enable Scout. You can also follow along with our example project to get a feel for all of Scout’s capabilities.
Learn Scout
Now that you’re ready — let’s get to the exciting part!

Dashboard
With the Scout Dashboard, you can easily share image analyses within your organization. This tool empowers your teams to collectively evaluate image security across Docker Hub, JFrog Artifactory, and Amazon ECR.

You can also access a holistic Software Supply Chain overview and find immediate remediation guidance. This helps highlight essential vulnerabilities and concerns that need attention.

Image analysis
The Scout image analysis capability is readily available for Docker Hub repositories by default. Once you’ve activated image analysis for a repository, Scout will automatically analyze newly pushed images and continually reevaluate them!

Better yet, you can integrate it with third-party registries like Amazon ECR and JFrog Artifactory. Or you can execute image analysis directly on your local development machine.
