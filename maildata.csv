Navigating the Intersection of Law and Technology: Two Challenges in Social Informatics

[Abstract]
In this lecture, we explore two challenges related to the use of AI for providing social/legal services.The first challenge is rather general and deals with the gap between the two domain experts needed in order to create social informatics solutions: the social domain expert and the AI expert.The second challenge focuses on law and deals with the asymmetry between using AI to identify and report violations of the law and using AI to handle such violations.The two challenges are based on the experience of the speaker with supporting consumer protection associations in Europe. We will discuss the two challenges and possible solutions.

Dr. Tomer Libal is a researcher in AI and Law in the University of Luxembourg and the founder of Enidia AI, a startup specializing in legal chatbots. Before joining the university of Luxembourg, he had positions in the American University of Paris, Inria France and Microsoft Research.

Congratulations! You’ve officially kicked off your journey with Docker Scout.

We’re so excited to help your team maintain a complete view of your Software Supply Chain more than ever before. Let’s start by getting you set up and showing you around core Scout features!
Getting started
Before you dive in, visit our quickstart guide! This’ll help you set up and enable Scout. You can also follow along with our example project to get a feel for all of Scout’s capabilities.
Learn Scout
Now that you’re ready — let’s get to the exciting part!

Dashboard
With the Scout Dashboard, you can easily share image analyses within your organization. This tool empowers your teams to collectively evaluate image security across Docker Hub, JFrog Artifactory, and Amazon ECR.

You can also access a holistic Software Supply Chain overview and find immediate remediation guidance. This helps highlight essential vulnerabilities and concerns that need attention.

Image analysis
The Scout image analysis capability is readily available for Docker Hub repositories by default. Once you’ve activated image analysis for a repository, Scout will automatically analyze newly pushed images and continually reevaluate them!

Better yet, you can integrate it with third-party registries like Amazon ECR and JFrog Artifactory. Or you can execute image analysis directly on your local development machine.

[タイトル／Title]
Everyday Teleoperation & Robot Bullying


[日時／Date&Time]
令和６年 ７月４日（木） １０時～
Thursday, July 4, 2024 | 10:00 AM -


[会場／Location]
総合研究7号館 情報1講義室 (1階 107)
7th Research Building, Lecture Room 1 (1F 107)


[Abstract: Daniel J. Rea]
Everyday Teleoperation Remote controlled robots, or teleoperation, is typically used by experts in industrial, scientific, or military contexts. At the same time, teleoperated robots have struggled to enter our lives in a meaningful way, despite many applications. In this talk, I describe why I think this is, my overall approach to tackling it, and the research I and my group have done to make teleoperating a robot easier for anyone in their daily life. This includes interface design to increase trust in the robot or believe it is faster or slower than it really is, developing and exploring new ways for people to express themselves with robots, and helping everyday people better understand robot sensor data.


[Biography: Daniel J. Rea]
Daniel J. Rea is an assistant professor at the University of New Brunswick and a frequent visitor and collaborator at Kyoto University with Dr. Takayuki Kanda. He earned his M.Sc. and Ph.D. at the University of Manitoba in 2015 and 2020. His focus is on user-centered design to improve the performance and experience of people remotely controlling robots. Side research interests include game design and applying game design to robotics and other fields, social human-robot interaction, and interaction design broadly.


[Abstract: Merel Keijsers]
As robots are perceived as social actors by humans, behaviour towards robots should be seen as social behaviour. This includes negative behaviours such as bullying, aggression, and abuse. In my research, I approach robot abuse from the perspective of social psychology, where dehumanisation is considered one of the main facilitators of aggressive behaviours, and aggression is an ultimate attempt to resolve norm violations (e.g. as the result of perceived relative deprivation, instability in hierarchy, or behaviour that does not follow expectations).


[Biography: Merel Keijsers]
Merel Keijsers is an assistant professor in psychology at John Cabot university, in Rome (Italy). She completed an undergraduate degree in social psychology as well as two master degrees (social & health psychology, and methodology & statistics of the social and behavioural sciences) at Utrecht university in the Netherlands. For her PhD, she went to the University of Canterbury, in New Zealand.
